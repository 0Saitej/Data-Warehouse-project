# Data-Warehouse-project
Building a modern data ware house with sql server , including ETL process, data modeling , analytics

📊 **Data Warehouse Project**

📌** Project Overview**

This project implements a Data Warehouse system designed to collect, integrate, transform, and analyze data from multiple sources to support business intelligence and decision-making.The objective of this project is to design a scalable and optimized data warehouse architecture using dimensional modeling techniques, ETL pipelines, and analytical reporting.

**2. Project Objectives**

 ~ Design a structured data warehouse schema (Star or Snowflake Schema).
 
 ~ Perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations.
 
 ~ Clean and transform raw data into analytical format.
 
 ~ Build fact and dimension tables.
 
 ~ Enable efficient querying for business insights.
 
 ~ Create dashboards and reports for analysis.
 
**3. Architecture Overview**

**Data Sources**

~ Raw data from CSV files, databases, or APIs.

~ Transactional or operational data.

**Staging Layer**

~ Temporary storage for extracted data.

~ Data cleaning and preprocessing.

**Data Warehouse Layer**

~ Fact Tables.

~ Dimension Tables.

~ Optimized structure for analytical queries.

**Analytics and Reporting Layer**

~ SQL Queries.

~ BI Tools such as Power BI or Tableau.

~ Dashboards and KPI reports.

**4. Schema Design**

~ The warehouse is designed using Dimensional Modeling.

Fact Table

~ Stores measurable metrics such as sales, revenue, or quantity.

Dimension Tables

~ Time Dimension.

~ Customer Dimension.

~ Product Dimension.

~ Location Dimension.

4.Schema Type: Star Schema (or Snowflake Schema based on implementation).

**5. ETL Process**

Extract

~ Data collected from source systems.

Transform

~ Data cleaning and validation.

~ Data normalization and aggregation.

Load

~ Insert data into fact and dimension tables.

**Key Features**

~ Optimized query performance.

~ Indexed fact tables.

~ Data validation and cleaning.

~ Aggregation for reporting.

~ Business KPI generation.
