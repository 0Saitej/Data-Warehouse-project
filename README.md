# Data-Warehouse-project
Building a modern data ware house with sql server , including ETL process, data modeling , analytics

📊 **Data Warehouse Project**
📌** Project Overview**
This project implements a Data Warehouse system designed to collect, integrate, transform, and analyze data from multiple sources to support business intelligence and decision-making.The objective of this project is to design a scalable and optimized data warehouse architecture using dimensional modeling techniques, ETL pipelines, and analytical reporting.

**2. Project Objectives**
 ~ Design a structured data warehouse schema (Star or Snowflake Schema).
 ~ Perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations.
 ~ Clean and transform raw data into analytical format.
 ~ Build fact and dimension tables.
 ~ Enable efficient querying for business insights.
 ~ Create dashboards and reports for analysis.

 
**3. Architecture Overview**
**Data Sources**
1.1 Raw data from CSV files, databases, or APIs.
1.2 Transactional or operational data.

**Staging Layer**
2.1 Temporary storage for extracted data.
2.2 Data cleaning and preprocessing.

**Data Warehouse Layer**
3.1 Fact Tables.
3.2 Dimension Tables.
3.3 Optimized structure for analytical queries.

**Analytics and Reporting Layer**
4.1 SQL Queries.
4.2 BI Tools such as Power BI or Tableau.
4.3 Dashboards and KPI reports.

**4. Schema Design**
1.The warehouse is designed using Dimensional Modeling.

Fact Table
2.1 Stores measurable metrics such as sales, revenue, or quantity.

Dimension Tables
3.1 Time Dimension.
3.2 Customer Dimension.
3.3 Product Dimension.
3.4 Location Dimension.

4.Schema Type: Star Schema (or Snowflake Schema based on implementation).

**5. ETL Process**

Extract
1.1 Data collected from source systems.

Transform
2.1 Data cleaning and validation.
2.2 Data normalization and aggregation.

Load
3.1 Insert data into fact and dimension tables.

**Key Features**

Optimized query performance.
Indexed fact tables.
Data validation and cleaning.
Aggregation for reporting.
Business KPI generation.
